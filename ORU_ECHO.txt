Recent echocardiogram showed severe aortic~stenosis (aortic valve area 0.68 cm2, mean gradient 31 mm Hg which~increased to 59 mm Hg with dobutamine). He is referred for palliative~balloon aortic valvuloplasty as he is high risk for surgery. TAVI is~not feasible from the transfemoral approach and would be complex from~either the transapical or transaortic approaches.~~PROCEDURES PERFORMED: (1) Aortography (Thoracic), (2) Left Heart~Catheterization, (3) Percutaneous Valvuloplasty (Aortic Valve), (4)~Right Heart Catheterization and (5) Temp Venous Cardiac Pacemaker.~Consent was obtained from the patient.~~MISC: Pre-Procedure vital signs: HR = 53 BPM, ECG Rhythm = SR, BP =~171/63 mmHg, RR = 16 BPM, Arterial O2 Sat = 97%, Height = 162 cm,~Weight = 79.6 Kg, BSA = 1.85 m2 and BMI = 30.33 Kg/m2.~~(2) NON-INVASIVE HEMODYNAMICS: HR = 53 BPM, ECG Rhythm = SR, BP =~171/63 mmHg, RR = 16 BPM, Arterial O2 Sat = 97%, Height = 162 cm,~Weight = 79.6 Kg, BSA = 1.85 m2 and BMI = 30.33 Kg/m2. Arterial O2~Saturation = 97% (Arterial O2 Concentration = 149 ml/l). Venous O2~Saturation = 68% (Venous O2 Concentration = 105 ml/l and A-V O2~Difference = 44 ml/l). Hemoglobin = 11.3 mg/dl. VO2 consumption =~194ml/min (VO2 consumption index = 104.9 ml/min/m2).~~INVASIVE HEMODYNAMICS:~~                           BASELINE VALUES     POST-AORTIC~VALVULOPLASTY~RA Pressure (mmHg)         14 / 15 / 10~RV Pressure (mmHg)         54 / 11~PA Pressure (mmHg)         54 / 25 / 36~PCW Pressure (mmHg)        21 / 25 / 20~LV Pressure (mmHg)         190 / 22            168 / 37~Aortic Pressure (mmHg)     160 / 57 / 90       155 / 46 / 62~CO/CI (l/m/m2)             4.41 / 2.38         4.30 / 2.32~~SVR (dynes/sec/cm-5)       1451~PVR (dynes/sec/cm-5)       290~PVR (Wood units)           3.63~Transpulmonary Grad (mmHg) 16~RVSWI (mmHg ml/m2)         1168~~AORTIC VALVE EVALUATION:~~A) BASELINE: The aortic valve area is severely reduced (the calculated~valve area is 0.86 cm2 or 0.46 cm2/m2 indexed for BSA). The aortic~valve gradients are 30 mmHg (peak) and 31 mmHg (mean).~~B) POST VALVULOPLASTY: The aortic valve area is moderately reduced (the~calculated valve area is 1.14 cm2 or 0.61 cm2/m2 indexed for BSA). The~aortic valve gradients are 13 mmHg (peak) and 17 mmHg (mean).~~(3) BALLOON AORTIC VALVULOPLASTY NOTE: Successful balloon aortic~valvuloplasty was performed reducing the mean aortic valve gradient~from 31 mm Hg to 17 mm Hg and increasing the aortic valve area from~0.86 cm2 to 1.14 cm2.~~PROCEDURE DETAILS: Heparin was used during the procedure and the ACT~monitored. Access was obtained in the right femoral artery with a 6F~sheath and in right femoral vein with an 8F sheath. Right femoral~angiography was performed to assess proper placement of the right~femoral artery sheath.  The femoral artery underwent preclosure using~two Perclose Proglide suture closure devices placed at orthogonal~angles and a 12F sheath then inserted using dilators as necessary.~Right heart catheterization was then performed via the 8F sheath in the~right femoral vein with standard pulmonary wedge pressure catheter.~Aortography was then performed using a 6F Langston pigtail catheter to~define the coplanar view of the aortic valve cusps. The aortic valve~was crossed with a 6F AL1 catheter and an .035 inch straight guide~wire. The crossing catheter was then exchanged for the 6F Langston~pigtail catheter and baseline aortic valve gradients and aortic valve~area obtained. The pulmonary wedge pressure catheter was then removed~and 5F pacing wire placed in the right ventricle (RV). A Confida wire~was then placed into the LV. A 4 x 22 mm Nucleus-X balloon was then~advanced across the aortic valve. The RV was paced at 180 bpm and the~balloon inflated three times. Repeat measurement of aortic gradient and~calculation of valve area was performed. The right femoral artery~access site was then closed with the two sutures from preclosure and~right femoral vein access site was then closed with manual pressure.~~(4) FINISH-UP SUMMARY: A total of 28 ml of ioversol (Optiray 350) was~administered during the procedure. Fluoroscopy time was 13 min 58 sec.~Vascular access was closed in the lab using a special closure device~(Proglide x 2, device successful). Following the procedure, the patient~was discharged to 7-1400.~~POST-PROCEDURE VITALS: HR = 50 BPM and BP = 151/66 mmHg.~~PROCEDURE EVENTS: No significant procedure-related events.~~ACCESS SITE EVENTS: No significant access site-related events.~~CONCLUSIONS:~~1. Severe aortic stenosis.~2. Elevated left heart filling pressures.~3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.~4. Normal cardiac index.~5. Successful percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty.~~PLAN: The patient is to be admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization~Service for observation and intravenous diuresis post elective balloon~aortic valvuloplasty.~~***Signature on file***~_________________________~David A Krusch, MD~Director, Catheterization Laboratory~ (present entire service)~OTHER STAFF INVOLVED IN SERVICE: Rachel Roskowski, CVT (CARDIOVASCULAR~TECHNICIANS), Matthew Jonovich, MD (CATH LAB FELLOWS), Jane Doe,~RN (CATH LAB NURSES), John Doe, RN (CATH LAB NURSES), RN (CATH LAB NURSES).~                      ******REPORT DISTRIBUTION LIST******~~PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER: Mr PCP, REFERRAL PROVIDER: Mr Ref||||||F
